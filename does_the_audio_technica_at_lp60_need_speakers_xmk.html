The Audio Technica AT-LP60 Fully Automatic Stereo Turntable System certainly ticks many boxes. </p>

<p>Commandez sur Amazon ! Livraison gratuite dès 25 euros. What the AT-LP60-BT does provide, though, is convenience. Eliminating the need for a full-on console to power a turntable and send the sound to a set of home theater speakers is an attractive option. Audio-Technica isn't the first company to do pack in Bluetooth, as Ion recently released a wireless. </p>
