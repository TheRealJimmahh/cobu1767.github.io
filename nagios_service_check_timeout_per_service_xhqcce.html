The Services Coming back with the message seems to be isolated to specific servers and not that much specific services. Any one got some advice on how I canI adjusted all the host, service and nitofication check periods and timeouts (well that what I think is the timeouts) and incresed However, these hosts were in our DMZ and the firewall was not allowing ping (ICMP) traffic to the hosts. Instead we need to use check_tcp plugin to test for specific tcp port that should be open. The default port used by Nagios for all service checks to NRPE (and NSCP clients in NRPE mode) Increase nagios service check timeout. Or use a wrapper scripts which returns an unknown status before the timeout, when the wrapped script does not return.

Nagios executes a command, check_nrpe, to connect to a NRPE service. check_nrpe has a timeout paramer, -t. This parameter must have a bigger value How nagios works? For each service (counter) nagios executes each given period aStatus Information shows the current status of the service. It is a string that is displayed on the NagiosMissing backups – this counter checks the last date/time of successful Full database backup We have two Nagios servers each for monitoring different networks.

The nagios.cfg service check timeout is a catch-all for those that don t terminate themselves when they should. Ideally, each command definition would have a specific timeout for each plugin defined with -t and the nagios.cfg timeout would be the max possible value of your timeouts. <b>About nagios check timeout - Centreon Forum.</b> GroundWork Nagios getting a alot of Service Check Timed Out Hey As of lately my GroundWork Monitor (running on Debian5) has been failing on allot of checks with the message Service Check Timed. <b>Nagios SNMP time out - Spiceworks.</b> Описание сервиса, т.е. define service: active_checks_enabled 1 # Включить активные проверки.На ~10ой минуте после недоступности хоста/сервиса Nagios делает очередную проверку и определяет что хост/сервис down, но оповещение сразу не шлет, а в дело вступает переменная. </p>

<p>Service_check_timeout is a global variable and applies to all checks. It would be good to have capability to define timeout for each service. In our system we have some very long running checks but we do not want to increase the service_check_timeout value as it impacts all other checks that should be finished within that period. How do I set an individual timeout setting per service check. All timeouts default to 60 seconds as per the main configuration but I require that oneIf you know that you have a check that will take longer for a good reason then I suggest raising this limit in nagios.cfg. There is no setting for service.

And the second problem was that the in the command definition The thing is that the Service check time out prohibit you from passing 60 sec duration, even if you use check_nrpe, this is for all Nagios checks. You may increase the duration but it will impact all checks, while i am interesting in extending the check duration for specific checks. We have service_check_timeout_state in the nagios.cfg file to "u" for Unknown.

I have a self made plugin. it s a simple bash script. Because of connection latency it take a bit more than 10 seconds to execute. But this is self made so there should not be any timeout set! It should fall in timeout when it reach the service_check_timeout limit that is defined in the main configuration file. But it does it before…. Your check command doesn t match your manual test. If you want Nagios to perform the check in the same way that you re testing it manually, your service definition would have to be like this due to the way your check command is defined:. Периодически получали ошибку Service Check Timed Out при проверке Вин машины через NRPE (NSClient++).В результате наткнулся в сети на описание переменной в конфиге nagios: Format: service_check_timeout=seconds Example: service_check_timeout=60.

We are monitoring our routers, switches and ASAs usingWe have six 6500 series switches that are not returning SMTP data to the Nagios server.error from Nagios is 'Service Check Timed. This setting determines the state Nagios will report when a service check times out - that is does not respond within service_check_timeout seconds. This can be useful if a machine is running at too high a load and you do not want to consider a failed service check to be critical (the default). The only setting for service check timeout that I see is the global service_check_timeout setting. Is there a setting that can be applied per command or per service check? I have some long running service checks, but they are anomalies and I would rather get timeouts for other services earlier than change the setting for all services. <b>Nagios Timeouts einstellen - Nagios Core - Monitoring Portal.</b> Just like most Nagios administrators out there I am often required to add multiple hosts in Nagios monitoring which is quite simple task. But it takes a little while, sometimes longer, for Nagios to schedule checks for all the newly added hosts and services. To make the life easier for us Nagios. The global service check timeout you speak of can be thought of as a hard limit for checks. If there is a soft limit for a particular check, it needs to be implemented at the plugin level. One of these settings is the service_check_timeout interval. Nagios limits the execution time of plug-ins to this interval. If a plug-in is still running when the interval expires, Nagios stops the plug-in and shows the result as a Service check timeout error. Value: 0 = service is not volatile, 1 = service is volatile. check_command: This directive is used to specify the short name of the command that Nagios will run in order to check the status of the service. The maximum amount of time that the service check command can run is controlled by the service_check_timeout option. initial_state:.

When you manually check NRPE from a command line or testing from within GroundWork Monitor for example: /usr/local/groundwork/ nagios/libexec/check_nrpe Can anyone let me know how I would reduce time between Last Check Time and Next Scheduled Check on a particular service. I have a very critical task to monitor and the time between checks is currently 5 minutes, which is too long for this service. <b>Nagios (Host Check Timed Out) - RESOLVED - LinuxQuestions.org.</b> I m using service_check_timeout_state=c as default and for most of services it is desired for timeout to be considered critical. Unfortunately there are services for which I m only interested in critical state returned by plugin itself. Plugin timeout is this case shouldn t be critical but unknown instead. The problem was that both nagios servers are performing service checks and reporting results to master node, and all those check were performed perfectly. Master node had service freshness checking so if the monitoring servers could not complete checks master server would scheduled those checks from itself. In order to mark service as down Nagios does three checks and if all of them are failed then the service is marked down and administrator will gotIf you face some false alarms occasionally but the service is actually online then it makes sense to increase timeout value from default 10 seconds. Service check retries occur when a service check results in a non-OK state, but you have configured Nagios to retry the service more than once before responding to the error. Services in this situation are considered to be in "soft" states. Logging service check retries is mostly useful when attempting. <b>Reducing the time between checks on a Nagios server.</b> This forum was archived to /woltlab and is now in read-only mode.
